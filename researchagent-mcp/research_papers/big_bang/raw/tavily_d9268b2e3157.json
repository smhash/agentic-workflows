  "content": "The **Big Bang** is a physical theory that describes how the universe expanded from an initial state of high density and temperature. Big Bang cosmology models depend on three major assumptions: the universality of physical laws, the cosmological principle, and that the matter content can be modeled as a perfect fluid. The only parameter at this level of description is the mass-energy density: the geometry of the universe and its expansion is a direct consequence of its density.:\u200a73 All of the major features of Big Bang cosmology are related to these results.:\u200a49 In Big Bang cosmology, the mass\u2013energy density controls the shape and evolution of the universe. *Big Bang: The Origin of the Universe* (1st U.S. ed.).",
